1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,640
Jew, Gentile, like man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,840
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,320
We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there's room for everyone on the good earth,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,360
this rich, and can provide for everyone the way of life can be free and beautiful,

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,040
but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate,

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,280
has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical,

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,920
our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More the machinery.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,120
We need humanity. More than cleverness. We need kindness and gentleness.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,640
Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,440
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,400
cries out for the goodness in men. Crys out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,320
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world. Millions of despairing men, women and children.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,480
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,000
For those who can hear me I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,880
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die.

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,440
And the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,600
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to broods. Men who despise you and slave you who regiment your lives.

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,080
Tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel. Who drill you, tire to treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,160
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men. Wishing men with machine mines and machine hearts.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,080
You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,400
You don't hate. Only the unloved hate. The unloved and the unnatural.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery. Fight for liberty.

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,360
In the Seventh-Earth chapter of St. Lucat is written, the Kingdom of God is within man, not one man, not a group of men.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,000
But in all men, in you, you the people have the power. The power to create machines, the power to create happiness.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,760
You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,480
Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,480
A decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age a security.

31
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,080
By the promise of these things, broods have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,960
They never will. They take us freedom selves, but they enslave the people.

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,240
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers,

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,000
to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason.

35
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,560
A world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite.
